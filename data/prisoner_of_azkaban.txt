==Under Covers Prologue==
[It is pitch black, until we see what seems to be a small glow before it dims out. Then, the glow emits again, only bigger and revealing itself to be from a window, and then dims out. During all the while, a dog was heard barking. The glow from the window emits again, only this time, a familiar object was in front of the glow and as it dims out. The glow emits again and the dims away, just as the object then shines, revealing itself to be the Warner Bros. Pictures shield, in silver and the byline fades in underneath. The scenery behind the shield fades in from the darkness and the glow emits again, revealing to be Privet Drive and the glow is coming from Harry's bedroom and 4 Privet Drive. We zoom through the shield and towards the window]
:Harry: Lumos Maxima. [It was revealed that he is under the bed covers, and the glow is so bright that it lights up the room] Lumos Maxima [He casts the spell again which is the Lumos Maxima. Until he hears a toilet flushing and immediately goes back to sleep just as Vernon opens the door and turns on the light. He looks around in confusion before he turns off the light and closes the door and heads back to his bedroom. With him gone, Harry goes back to what he was doing.] Lumos Maxima [It revealed he was learning the Lumos Maxima from a book.] Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima! [The camera immediately zooms out from the covers, through the window where we see the film's title floating around in rays of light. We then zoom back into Harry's bedroom. As soon as Harry hears Vernon coming from his bedroom, he immediately returns to sleep just as Vernon opens the door and turns on the light. He looks around suspiciously just before he turns off the light and closes the door. Harry looks at the door and then smiles to himself before he really goes to sleep as we iris out.]

==Aunt Marge's Big Mistake==
[It is again pitch black. A doorbell ringing sound is heard multiple times]
:Aunt Marge: Harry! Harry! Harry! Open the door.
[Cut from black to the foyer, where Harry opens the front door. It is raining outside and Aunt Marge exhales as she brings her umbrella down and gives it to Harry. She passes the foyer into the kitchen where Aunt Petunia stands waiting. Aunt Marge's pet bulldog Ripper is on a leash. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia exchange greetings as Ripper lifts up on his hind legs at Aunt Petunia. We then cut to Harry and Uncle Vernon in the foyer, where Harry unfolds a small parchment while Uncle Vernon takes off his car coat.]
:Harry: Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
:Uncle Vernon: What is it?
:Harry: Nothing. School stuff.
:Uncle Vernon: Later, perhaps, if you behave.
:Harry: I will if she does.
:Aunt Marge: Oh, you're still here, are you?
:Harry: Yes.
:Aunt Marge: Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful way. [She hands Ripper's leash over to Petunia] Damn good of my brother to keep you. [She goes to Vernon to say something to him] He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep, Vernon.
[Laughter is heard nearby. Hearing that, Aunt Marge looks delighted. She walks up to the couch, where the laughter has come from Harry's fat cousin Dudley, who is watching TV and eating snacks]]
:Aunt Marge: Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh?

==The Knight Bus==
:[Harry runs down the stairs, pulling his trunk]
:Uncle Vernon: You bring her back! You bring her back now! You put her right!
:Harry: No, she deserved what she got!

==The Leaky Cauldron==
:[Inside the Leaky Cauldron, a man is magically stirring his drink while reading Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time.]

==The Monster Book of Monsters==
:[The camera pans up from a Muggle London street and into Harry's room at the Leaky Cauldron. A train passes by, causing the whole room to shake. Harry turns and walks over to look at his new books.]

==In Grave Danger==
:[A maid walks up to a door in the Leaky Cauldron.]
:Maid: [knocking on the door] Housekeeping!

==The Dementor==
:[Mrs. Weasley is carrying Scabbers as she runs to catch up with the Hogwarts Express.]
:Mrs. Weasley: Ron! Ron! [hands Scabbers to Ron through a train window] Oh, for goodness sake, don't lose him!
:[Students wave as the train pulls out of the station. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are now looking for a compartment.]
:Harry: I didn't mean to blow her up, I just - I lost control.
:Ron: Brilliant.
:Hermione: Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
:Harry: I think I was lucky not to be arrested, actually.
:Ron: I still think it was brilliant.

==Welcome and Warning==
:[Harry looks at his reflection in the train window. The scene then fades to horseless carriages carrying the students to Hogwarts.]
:Hogwarts Choir: In the cauldron boil and bake, fillet of a fenny snake, scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, witches' mummy, maw and gulf.
:[Cut to the Great Hall, where this is being sung by a choir of students who are holding frogs. As they sing, lightning flashes outside.]
:Hogwarts Choir: Double, double, toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Something wicked this way comes!

==Tea Leaves==
:[A bluebird flies past the Clock Tower, through the Covered Bridge, and out into the Hogwarts grounds. It then flies too close to the Whomping Willow and gets thwacked.]

==Buckbeak==
:[The third years are heading down to Hagrid's hut.]
:Ron: You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black, do you?

==Boggart in the Wardrobe==
:[The ghosts of the Headless Hunt "crash" into the Entrance Hall and then ride through the Great Hall. His arm now bandaged, Draco is sitting with his female companion, Pansy Parkinson.]
:Pansy: Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
:Draco: It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. According to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two, and I, uh, could've lost my arm.

==Talent for Trouble==
:[Three girls rush to join a crowd of students being addressed by Professor McGonagall.]
:McGonagall: Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade Village are a privilege.

==Flight of the Fat Lady==
:[The students are heading up the Grand Staircase.]
:Ron: Honeydukes Sweet Shop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

==Substitute Teacher==
:[A gate comes down, followed by a door that locks itself repeatedly.]

==Grim Defeat==
:Snape: The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer," which means "man" and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.

==The Marauder's Map==
:[Harry and Lupin are walking in a forested area.]
:Lupin: Is there no chance of fixing it?
:Harry: No.

==Who's There?==
:[The camera pans through Honeydukes. Neville is about to suck on a lollipop when it's suddenly ripped out of his hand and carried out the door.]

==I hope he finds me==
:[Harry, Ron, and Hermione are standing in a Hogsmeade street.]
:Ron: Those weasels! They never told me about any Marauder's Map!

==The Patronus==
:[Snow is melting as spring arrives.]

==Seeing the Impossible==
[Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk into the courtyard leading to the Covered Bridge]
:Hermione: Beautiful day.
:Ron: Gorgeous. Unless, of course, you’ve been ripped to pieces!
:Harry: Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
:Hermione: Ronald has lost his rat.
:Ron: I haven’t lost anything! Your cat killed him!
:Hermione: Rubbish.
:Ron: Harry, you’ve seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone!
:Hermione: Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets! [Crookshanks climbs onto one of the stone walls behind them as they walk on to the Covered Bridge]
:Ron: Your cat killed him!
:Hermione: Did not!
:Ron: Did.
:Hermione: Didn’t.
[They meet up with Hagrid as he is skipping rocks at the lake.]
:Hermione: How’d it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
:Hagrid: Well, first off, the Committee members took turns talking about why we were there. [throws another rock bouncing across the lake] Then, I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then, Lucius Malfoy got up. Well you can imagine, he said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
:Hermione: [as Hagrid skips another rock] And then?
:Hagrid: Then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
:Ron: [obviously outraged] They’re not sacking you?!
:Hagrid: No, I’m not sacked. [skips yet another rock, then speaks with his voice breaking] Buckbeak’s been sentenced to death!
[He furiously throws his last rock in the water with a loud splash and sniffles; behind him, Harry stands up, shocked by the sound of these words; he, Ron, and Hermione walk up to the water’s edge as Hagrid lets out a sad sigh.]

==Professor Trelawney's Prediction==
:Trelawney: [voice-over] Broaden your minds! You must look beyond!
:[Harry is looking into a crystal ball in Divination class. Ron is asleep.]
:Trelawney: The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. 

==Witnesses To An Execution==
[A scraping sound is heard, and a man is shown as he sits against the tree-like structure in the courtyard, with crows all around him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione step out, and see the man, [[Walden Macnair]], sharpening a massive axe blade. He looks up at them as they approach; Hermione scowls at him as she walks past, obviously knowing that he intends to use it on Buckbeak. Macnair looks at Harry and grins maliciously as he continues sharpening his axe. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk along the Covered Bridge, heading to Hagrid's cabin.]
:Hermione: I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
:Ron: [as they reach the other end of the bridge] It just got worse. [they see Draco and his pals looking down at Hagrid’s house from the hilltop]
:Draco: What did I tell you? Father said I can keep the hippogriff’s head. I think I’ll donate it to the Gryffindor’s common room. [enraged, Hermione quickly walks towards Draco] Oh, this is going to be rich.
:Crabbe: [seeing Harry and his friends approaching] Look who’s here.
:Draco: Ah, come to see the show? [happily holds out his arms]
:Hermione: You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! [points her wand at Malfoy’s throat in her rage]
:Ron: Hermione, no! He’s not worth it. [Draco stands there whimpering as Hermione keeps her wand against his throat, then lowers it and turns away. Draco chuckles; next second, Hermione spins around and punches him in the face.]
:Crabbe: [as he and the other boy help Draco to his feet] Malfoy, are you okay? Let’s go! Quick!
:Draco: [as he and his friends run to the bridge] Not a word to anyone. Understood? I’m gonna get that jumped-up Mudblood! Mark my words!
:Hermione: That felt good.
:Ron: Not good. Brilliant.
[Hermione smiles with satisfaction. The three of them then head down the steps to Hagrid’s house, walking past Buckbeak, who’s chained up in the pumpkin patch, awaiting his approaching execution.]
:Hagrid: [as he and Harry look out the window at Buckbeak] Oh, look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through ‘em.
:Harry: Why don’t we just set him free?
:Hagrid: [wishing he could, but knows that he can’t] They’d know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble. He’s coming down, you know, Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... when it happens. [walking away from the window] Great man, Dumbledore. Great man. [Hagrid’s flobberworm squeals; he throws it a piece of food, which it eats in one bite]
:Hermione: We’ll stay with you, too, Hagrid.
:Hagrid: You’ll do no such thing! [points at the window] Think I want you seeing something like that? No! You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron... [he picks up a plastic container and opens it and pulls Scabbers out]
:Ron: [overjoyed to see his rat alive] Scabbers. You’re alive! [takes Scabbers from Hagrid]
:Hagrid: You want to keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.
:Hermione: [as Ron turns around] I think that means you owe someone an apology.
:Ron: Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I’ll let him know.
:Hermione: I meant me. [suddenly, the vase on the table breaks]
:Hagrid: Blimey. What was that? [Hermione looks closely and finds a small rock with a snail shell pattern on it]
:Harry: [a rock hits him in the back of the head] Ow. [he turns around and looks out the window] Hagrid. [beckoning Hagrid to the window]
:Hagrid: [walking to the window and looking out] Oh, crikey. [Fudge, Dumbledore, and Macnair are walking towards Hagrid’s house, talking; Fudge glances at Buckbeak as he goes]
:Dumbledore: No, Minister. Over this way.
:Hagrid: [feeling very tense now] It’s late. It’s nearly dark. You shouldn’t be here. [going to his basket and grabbing a blanket] Someone sees you outside the castle this time of night, you’ll be in trouble. Big trouble, particularly you, Harry. [there is a knock at the door] With you in a moment. [throwing the blanket over his flobberworm] Quick. Quick! [Ron and Hermione head for the back door as Dumbledore knocks on the door again]
:Harry: Hagrid. It’ll be fine. It’ll be okay.
:Hagrid: [smiles slightly at Harry’s attempt to give him emotional support] Go on. Go on!
:Dumbledore: [as Hermione opens the back door] That’s the ling you can see over there on the slope. [all three men have their backs turned, unaware that Harry and his friends are there; Hagrid opens the door to let them in] Ah, Hagrid.
:Hagrid: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. [Fudge graciously steps inside] Minister, just make your way through. Have a tea if you like.
:Fudge: [obviously not thirsty] No, Hagrid. [Dumbledore and Macnair follow him inside] Gentlemen...
:Dumbledore: [Harry, Ron, and Hermione race to the rear of the pumpkin patch] I’d like a cup of tea.
:Fudge: [as Hagrid watches Harry, Ron, and Hermione leaving] Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereafter called “The Condemned”, shall be executed this day at sundown.
:Hagrid: Dear, dear...
:Dumbledore: Now, now, Hagrid. It’ll be all right.
:Fudge: [as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue eavesdropping from the pumpkin patch] The executioner shall dispatch the condemned by means of beheading. [Hermione hears a twig snap behind her and turns around]
:Harry: What?
:Hermione: I thought I just saw... Never mind.
:Ron: Let’s go.
[As Harry, Ron, and Hermione run towards the steps leading back to the castle, Buckbeak suddenly looks up. Ron glances back at him as they go.]
:Hagrid: Buckbeak didn’t mean no harm.
[Buckbeak lets out an uneasy bray as he watches the three teenagers running back to the castle. Harry takes a last look at Buckbeak before racing after Ron and Hermione up the castle stairs. From the hilltop, Ron, Hermione, and Harry look down at Hagrid’s house. Hagrid and Dumbledore are standing on the front steps of the house, Fudge is standing right in front of the steps, and Macnair faces them, standing just inches from the pumpkin patch. Dumbledore points at the pumpkin patch; as he turns to go inside the cabin, Macnair raises his axe and walks toward Buckbeak, hidden from view by the trees. Hagrid sadly takes a last look at his feathered friend, then turns to go inside his house. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watch with mounting tension; even Scabbers seems a little skittish. Hermione closes her eyes briefly and murmurs. She silently gasps as she sees Macnair lift his axe above his head, tilt it backwards, then bring it down with lightning speed. A chopping sound is heard; the execution has been carried out. The crows that have been hanging around Macnair fly away, squawking and cawing.]

==The Whomping Willow==
:Ron: Oh, no.
:[Hermione cries into Ron's shoulder. Harry puts his head on Hermione's shoulder.]

==Sirius Black==
:[Harry and Hermione emerge from the floor into an old house.]
:Hermione: We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?

==Peter Pettigrew==
:Ron: Harry, what did you just do?!
:Hermione: You attacked a teacher!

==Friends Become Foes==
:[Sirius and Harry are helping Ron back through the passageway Hermione is following behind.]
:Sirius: Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.

==The Dementor's Kiss==
:[Harry runs through the woods and sees Sirius lying next to a lake. He runs down to him.]
:Harry: Sirius!
:[He turns Sirius over, revealing him to be unconscious.]
:Harry: No. Sirius!

==Hermione's Secret==
:[Harry wakes up in a bed in the hospital wing. It's still night.]
:Hermione: Harry?
:Harry: I saw my dad.
:Hermione: What?
:Harry: He sent the Dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
:Hermione: Listen, Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
:Harry: [scrambling out of bed] You mean they're going to kill him?
:Hermione: No, it's worse, much worse. They're going to suck out his soul.
:[Dumbledore enters.]
:Hermione: Headmaster, you've got to stop them! They've got the wrong man!
:Harry: It's true, sir, Sirius is innocent.
:Ron: [in bed with his leg still broken] It's Scabbers who did it.
:Dumbledore: Scabbers?
:Ron: He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat, but then they gave him an owl and--
:Hermione: Point is we know the truth. Please believe us.
:Dumbledore: I do, Miss Granger, but I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen-year-old wizards will convince few others. [walks up to Ron's bed] A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. [As Dumbledore speaks he absentmindedly taps Ron's broken leg, causing Ron to yelp in pain. The Clock Tower starts chiming, and Dumbledore moves back towards the entrance.] Mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the law, Miss Granger. You must not be seen, and you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight, more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. [steps into the doorway but then turns back for one last comment] Oh, by the way: When in doubt, I found retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck. [leaves]
:Ron: What the bloody hell was that all about?
:Hermione: Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk.
:[Hermione puts a necklace around hers and Harry's necks. On the end of it is an hourglass. Harry reaches up to examine it, but Hermione swats his hand away. She spins the hourglass three times. A ticking sound begins, and everything around Harry and Hermione rushes backwards. It stops with them standing in a deserted hospital wing during the daytime.]
:Harry: What just happened? Where's Ron?
:Hermione: [looks at a clock] 7:30. [turns to Harry] Where were we at 7:30?
:Harry: I don't know, going to Hagrid's?
:Hermione: Come on, and we can't be seen!
:[Hermione takes off running and Harry follows.]
:Harry: Hermione!
:[They go down the Clock Tower and across the courtyard to the Covered Bridge.]
:Harry: Hermione! Hermione, wait!
:[Harry and Hermione reach the end of the Covered Bridge.]
:Harry: Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing!
:[The scene from before is playing out.]
:Draco: Ah, come to see the show?
:Earlier Hermione: You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
:Harry: That's us.
:Ron: Hermione, no! He’s not worth it.
:Harry: This is not normal.
:[Hermione pushes him out of sight. She holds up the hourglass.]
:Hermione: This is a [[Time Turner]], Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
:Harry: You mean we've gone back in time?
:Hermione: Yes. [puts the Time Turner away] Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. [looks out at the scene] Clearly something happened he wants us to change.
:[The earlier Hermione punches Draco.]
:Harry: Good punch.
:Hermione: Thanks.
:Crabbe: Let’s go! Quick!
:Hermione: Malfoy's coming.
:[She and Harry jump onto the ground beside the bridge before they can be seen by Draco and his friends.]
:Draco: [as he and his friends run to the bridge] Not a word to anyone. Understood? I’m gonna get that jumped-up Mudblood! Mark my words!
:Earlier Hermione: That felt good.
:Ron: Not good. Brilliant.
:Earlier Harry: Come on, we should be at Hagrid's.
:[The trio heads down the hill. Following at a distance, the time-traveling Harry and Hermione reach the edge of the hill.]

==Onlookers to the Rescue==
:Harry: Look, Buckbeak's still alive.
:Hermione: Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go.
:[Harry and Hermione run down to hide in the pumpkin patch.]
:Hagrid: Great man, Dumbledore. Great man.
:[Harry turns to see Fudge, Dumbledore, and Macnair are approaching.]
:Harry: Here they come. I better hurry.
:Hermione: Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
:Ron: Scabbers. You're alive!
:Hagrid: You want to keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.
:Harry: That's Pettigrew.
:Hermione: Harry, you can't.
:Harry: Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just sit here!
:Hermione: Yes, and you must! [she restrains him] Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in you'll think you've gone mad! Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time, Harry. We can't be seen.
:Dumbledore: Remember this footpath, Minister?
:Fudge: Yes, yes.
:Hermione: Fudge is coming, and we aren't leaving. Why aren't we leaving?
:[Hermione suddenly notices a small rock with a snail shell pattern on it. She looks at it for a moment and then throws it into Hagrid's hut, breaking the vase on the table.]
:Harry: Are you mad?
:[Hermione throws another rock, hitting the earlier Harry in the back of the head.]
:Earlier Harry: Ow.
:Harry: Ow. That hurt.
:Hermione: Sorry.
:[Fudge, Dumbledore, and Macnair reach Hagrid's hut. Dumbledore knocks on the door.]
:Dumbledore: That's the ling you can see over there on the slope. Ah, Hagrid.
:[The earlier Hermione opens the back door.]
:Hermione: We're coming out the back door. Go!
:[Fudge, Dumbledore, and Macnair enter Hagrid's house. The time-traveling Harry and Hermione run into the woods as their earlier selves enter the pumpkin patch. Hermione peeks out from behind a tree, looking at her earlier self.]
:Hermione: Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
:Harry: Hermione.
:[Hermione breaks a twig and quickly hides behind the tree again. Her earlier self turns around.]
:Earlier Harry: What?
:Earlier Hermione: I thought I just saw... Never mind.
:Ron: Let's go.
:[Harry and Hermione return to the pumpkin patch as their earlier selves head back up towards the castle. Hermione checks to make sure the coast is clear.]
:Hermione: Okay, go, Harry! Go!
:[Harry approaches Buckbeak. A couple crows peck at his feet.]
:Harry: Go away. Get off.
:[Harry bows to Buckbeak, who bows back. A crow pecks at Harry's hand as he takes Buckbeak's chain.]
:Harry: Ow.
:Fudge: Very well, gentlemen, shall we step outside?
:[The door to Hagrid's hut starts to open.]
:Dumbledore: Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
:Fudge: [as the door closes again] Yes, very well, perhaps it would be a good thing if...
:Harry: Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.
:[Harry pulls on the chain, but Buckbeak refuses to move.]
:Hermione: Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
:[Buckbeak finally seems to respond. Hermione runs off somewhere.]
:Harry: Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
:Fudge: Your name only.
:Dumbledore: It's such a very long name.
:Harry: Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
:Hermione: [reappearing with some dead ferrets] Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret.
:[Buckbeak gets up for this treat. Hermione tosses one to him.]
:Hermione: Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
:[Dumbledore leads Hagrid, Fudge, and Macnair outside. Harry and Hermione freeze in horror.]
:Dumbledore: Here we are, Minister. Follow me. Now, look there.
:Fudge: Where?
:Dumbledore: Look beyond the rocks.
:Fudge: What am I supposed to see?
:Dumbledore: Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
:Fudge: Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
:Dumbledore: And all the strawberries you see.
:[Dumbledore is directing Fudge to look away from where Harry and Hermione are standing.]
:Hermione: Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
:[Buckbeak is finally convinced to follow Harry and Hermione into the woods.]
:Fudge: Oh, let's get this over with.
:Dumbledore: All right.
:[They all turn to the pumpkin patch just after Buckbeak has left it.]
:Fudge: But where is it? I saw the beast just now. Not a moment ago!
:Dumbledore: How extraordinary.
:Hagrid: Buckbeak.
:Fudge: Oh, come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him.
:[Harry and Hermione are watching from the woods.]
:Dumbledore: I don't think the Minister's suggesting that you had anything to do with this, Hagrid. After all, how could you? You've been with us all the time.
:Hagrid: Well, right.
:Fudge: Well, well, we must search the grounds.
:Dumbledore: Search the skies, if you must, Minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you.
:[Dumbledore and Hagrid go back inside.]
:Hagrid: You'll find no small glasses in this house, Professor.
:[Macnair raises his axe and smashes a pumpkin in anger, a sight that the Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the hilltop will mistake for the execution.]

==Saving Lives==
:[Harry, Hermione, and Buckbreak are now running through the forest at night.]

==Truly Seen, Truly Free==
:[Harry and Hermione look up to a see a swarm of Dementors flying overhead.]

==Two Places at Once==
:[Buckbeak has landed in the Clock Tower courtyard. Sirius helps Hermione down from the hippogriff.]

==Mischief Managed==
:[Another bluebird flies into the Whomping Willow and gets thwacked.]

==The Firebolt==
:[Ghosts of the Headless Hunt ride around in the Entrance Hall.]

==End Credits Map==
:Harry: Lumos [His wand lighten up the screen, revealing the parchment] I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good. [The film title appears on the parchment when dark red ink soaks in, revealing to be the Marauder's Map. The map opens up and the first part of the credits roll with footprints going around the crew and cast's names. Afterwards, the rest of the credits continue as we scroll around the map in all sorts of directions, until we finally get to the last in credit notice "A P of A Productions Production"] Mischief managed. [The map closes and the film's title disappear as the red ink fades away from the map] Nox. [The light dims out from his wand. After about five seconds, a faint piano tune is heard before the "Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures" logo fades in.]
