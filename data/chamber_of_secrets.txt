==In a Cage==
:[In the clouds during sunset, we see the Warner Bros. Pictures shield moving towards the screen and rotates out of the shot. Then, the film's title in golden letters slowly zooms through the camera afterwards; it is a quiet summer evening in Surrey. [[Harry Potter]] is in his bedroom looking at the picture book that Rubeus Hagrid gave him at the end of his first year at Hogwarts; he looks at the picture of him as a baby with his parents, then turns the page to look at a picture of him with his closest friends, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]; he then hears his owl Hedwig chirping and hooting in her cage.]
:Harry: I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. [Hedwig nibbles at her lock, squawking loudly] Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
:Vernon: [angrily from downstairs] Harry Potter!
:Harry: [glances downstairs then looks at Hedwig before closing his book and going downstairs] Now you've done it.
[In the kitchen, Petunia is working on a cake as Harry enters.]
:Petunia: He's in there, Vernon.
[Harry enters the living room, where Uncle Vernon is getting Dudley dressed up.]
:Vernon: I'm warning you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
:Harry: But she's bored. If I could only let her out for... an hour or two.
:Vernon: [chuckles] So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
:Harry: But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
:Dudley: Who would want to be friends with you? [bumps Harry harshly]
:Vernon: I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you a were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
:Petunia: [to Dudley] Not now, bumpkins. It's for when the Masons arrive.
:Vernon: Which should be any minute. [motions for his family to come into the living room] Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?
:Petunia: In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
:Vernon: Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
:Dudley: I'll be waiting to open the door.
:Vernon: Excellent. [the three of them turn to Harry with scornful looks] And you...?
:Harry: I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
:Vernon: Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, and you will not mess it up.

==Dobby's Warning==
[Harry goes upstairs as the doorbell rings.]
:Vernon: [from below] Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
[Harry hears someone laughing madly in his room. He opens the door to find, a house elf named Dobby bouncing on his bed.]
:Dobby: Harry Potter! Such an honor it is! [Harry closes the door.]
:Harry: Who are you?
:Dobby: Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
:Harry: Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
:Dobby: Oh, oh, yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?
:Harry: Why don’t you sit down?
:Dobby: S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? [he soon begins to cry]
:Harry: Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! [Dobby cries louder] I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
:Dobby: [stops crying when he hears that word] Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
:Harry: You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
:Dobby: No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. [he then bangs his head on the dresser drawer repeatedly] Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
:Harry: Stop, Dobby! Dobby, shh! Dobby, please stop!
[From downstairs in the living room, the Dursleys and the Masons are having some wine as they hear the banging from above.]
:Vernon: Oh, don't mind that. It's just the... cat! [he chuckles lightly, as Mr. and Mrs. Mason look on, being convinced and concerned at the same time.]
:Dobby: [still banging his head on the drawer] Bad Dobby!
:Harry: Dobby, stop! Please be quiet. Are you all right?
:Dobby: Dobby had to punish himself, sir. [pushes a stool closer to Harry] Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
:Harry: Your family?
:Dobby: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. [gets up and sits on the stool] Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they knew Dobby was here... [shivers] But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. [Harry looks at him in surprise] There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
:Harry: What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
:Dobby: [trying to resist himself from saying something] Oh, he! Can’t say!
:Harry: Okay, I understand. You can’t say.
:Dobby: Don’t make me talk. L-- [Dobby gets on the desk, grabs the lamp and hits himself with it.] Bad Dobby!
:Harry: Dobby? Dobby, put the lamp down. [he keeps hitting himself, in the living room, Vernon is still doing his conversation with the Masons.]
:Vernon: So, when they arrive at the ninth hole-- [Dobby’s shout is heard, Vernon hears it upstairs while looking suspicious.]
:Harry: [trying to grab the lamp from Dobby] Give me the lamp! [Dobby keeps straining until Harry hears Vernon coming upstairs] Dobby, stop! [he finally grabs it from Dobby, grabs his rags, hides him in the closet, and closes the door] Get in there and keep quiet!
:Vernon: [opening the door, stomping into the room, and glaring at Harry] What the devil are you doing up here?!
:Harry: I was just... [Dobby slowly opens the closet door; Harry pushes it closed]
:Vernon: You've just ruined the punchline of my Japanese golfer joke.
:Harry: Sorry. [closes the closet door again]
:Vernon: [glances at the closet door, unaware of Dobby's presence, then lifts his finger as he turns his eyes back to Harry] One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy. [sees the closet door opening again] And fix that door.
:Harry: [closing the door again] Yes, sir. [Vernon glares at Harry as he walks out of the room, pulling the door closed; with Vernon gone, Harry opens the closet door to let Dobby out] See why I've got to go back? [Dobby removes a sock from his ear] I don't belong here; I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. [Dobby sniffs the sock and throws it aside and turns to Harry] It's the only place I've got friends.
:Dobby: Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?  Harry: Well, I expect they've been--hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me?
:Dobby: Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...  Harry: Give me those. Now.
:Dobby: No!
:Harry: Dobby, get back here! Dobby... Please... No  Dobby: Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.  Harry: I can't. Hogwarts is my home.  Dobby: Then Dobby must do it, sir. For Harry Potter's own good.
:Vernon: I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...

==Car Rescue==
:[Petunia and Dudley watch as Vernon drills bars into Harry's bedroom window.]

:Vernon: [after tightening the bars, he glares at Harry, who glares back at him through the window] You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!

:[Later that evening, as Harry is asleep in bed, he hears what sounds like a car engine outside. Waking up and putting on his glasses, he gets out of bed and walks to the window. Looking out the window, he sees a strange object moving through the sky. As he looks, the object appears to be a shooting star, before turning into two beams of light. A turquoise Ford Anglia car flies to Harry's bedroom window, then turns to the right as Harry and Hedwig silently watch. In the Ford Anglia is Ron, accompanied by his older twins, Fred and George.]

:Ron: [looking at Harry through the bars on his window] Hiya, Harry.

:Harry: [surprised to see his friends] Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?

:Ron: Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!

:[Eventually, Harry has gotten dressed, packed his Hogwarts trunk with some clothes, his books, pajamas, uniforms, and all other necessities, shuts it closed, and locks it.]

:Ron: [putting a hook at the bars on Harry's window] You'd better stand back. [Harry steps back as Ron turns to the twin in the drivers' seat] Let's go!

:[The car pulls the bars on Harry’s window off. SMASH! Petunia and Vernon wake up.]

:Petunia: Oh!

:Vernon: Now, what the hell’s he doing?
:[Harry picks up his trunk and makes for the window, where the car's trunk is open for it.]
:Vernon: Potter!

Dudley: [Also awake and on the landing] Dad! What’s going on!?

[Harry puts his trunk in the car.] 

George: Go, go, go, go! 

Dudley: Dad, hurry up! [Camera shows Vernon unlocking the locks on the door on Harry’s bedroom.]

[Harry picks up Hedwig's cage.]

Ron: Come on.

Fred: Come on.

Ron: Come on, Harry! Hurry up!

[Vernon unlocks Harry's door and opens it as Harry is about to climb out and into the car.]

Vernon: Petunia, he’s escaping! [Vernon grabs Harry’s ankle.]

Harry: Aah!

Dudley: Get him, Dad!

Harry: Aah!

Ron: [Seizes Harry’s waist.] I’ve got you, Harry!

Vernon: Come here!

Harry: [struggles to get out of Vernon’s grip.] Let go of me!

Vernon: Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!

Harry: Get off!

Ron: Drive!

Fred: Right.

George: Right!

Vernon: No! No! No! No! Aaaah! [Vernon falls from the window and lands in the garden.]

Dudley: Dad!

Vernon: Oh... Damn. [He stumbles out of the garden.]

[The car flies away.]

Ron: By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday!

:

==The Burrow==
[Fred walks to the window and opens it to unlock the door.]

Fred: Come on. Okay, come on. Shhh! Shhh!

[Fred is checking that the coast is clear then beckoning the others inside.]

Fred: Okay, come on

Ron: Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?

[George is half smiling.]

George: Yeah, Mum would never know

Ron: It’s not much, but it’s home

Harry: I think it’s...brilliant

[Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Ron slowly smiles.]

Mrs. Weasley: Where have you been?

[The boys nearly jump out of their skin. Mrs. Weasley stands in the doorway. Furious. She smiles sweetly at Harry.]

Mrs. Weasley: Harry, how wonderful to see you dear

[Mrs. Weasley turns back to Fred, George and Ron.]

Mrs. Weasley: Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could've died! You could've been seen!

[Mrs. Weasley turns back to Harry.]

Mrs. Weasley: Of  course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear

Ron: They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!

Mrs. Weasley: Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!

[Mrs. Weasley starts softening instantly.]

Mrs. Weasley: Care for a spot of tea, Harry?

[Ginny is walking down the stairs.]

Ginny: Mummy. Have you seen my jumper--

Mrs. Weasley: Yes dear. It was on the cat

[Ginny looked wide eyed at Harry.]

Harry: Hello. W-what did I do?

Ron: Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really

[Mr. Weasley comes in.]

Mr. Weasley: Morning, Weasleys

Fred, George and Ron: Morning, Dad

Mrs. Weasley: Morning Arthur!

Mr. Weasley: What a night. Nine raids. Nine!

Harry: (to Ron) Raids?

Ron: Dad works in the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating

Mr. Weasley: Well now. Who are you?

Harry: Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter

Mr. Weasley: Good Lord, are you really? Ron’s told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?

Mrs. Weasley: (darkly) This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night

Mr. Weasley: Did you really! How’d it go?!

[Mr. Weasley catches Mrs. Weasley's eye. Fred, George, Ron and Harry are hiding their laughter.]

Fred, George, Ron and Harry: Oh, it...

Mrs. Weasley: Arthur! 

[Everyone except Molly is trying very hard to stop laughing.]

Mr. Weasley: I mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?

Harry: Oh, umm...

[An owl, Errol with letters flew in, only to hit a window.]

Mrs. Weasley: Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?

Percy: Errol...

Ron: He’s always doing that

Percy: Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well

Mr. Weasley: Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. Doesn’t miss a trick, that man

Mrs. Weasley: Oh, no

Fred: This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone...

Mrs. Weasley: We’ll manage. Right then. There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this: Diagon Alley.

==To Diagon Alley==
:[Mrs. Weasley picks up a pot of the mantel.]
:Mrs. Weasley: You first, Harry dear
:[Mrs. Weasley offers Harry a flowerpot. At the bottom is a layer of very soft dust. Harry frowns in confusion.]
:Ron: But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum
:Harry: Floo Powder?
:Mrs. Weasley: Oh, well, you go first, Ron. So that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go. That's it
:Ron: Diagon Alley!
:[Ron disappears.]
:Mrs. Weasley: You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it. Mind your head. That's right. Now, take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly
:Harry: Diagonally
:[Harry disappears.]
:Mrs. Weasley: What did he say, dear?
:Mr. Weasley: "Diagonally"
:Mrs. Weasley: I thought he did

==Borgin and Burkes==
:[Harry landed in Borgin and Burkes. Harry goes into a cabinet. Draco and Lucius arrives to the store.]
:Lucius: Don't touch anything, Draco
:Draco: Yes, father
:Mr. Borgin: Uh, Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again. And young Master Malfoy, too. Delighted. I must show you, just in today and very reasonably--
:Lucius: I'm not buying today, Borgin. I'm selling
:Mr. Borgin: Selling?
:Lucius: Draco
:[Draco puts a box on the counter.]
:Lucius: You are aware no doubt that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids on private houses. There's even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act
:Mr. Borgin: Pure wizard blood is counting for less everywhere, I'm afraid
:Lucius: Not with me. Anyway, I brought a few items from home that might prove, uh...

== Flourish and Blotts ==

:[A copy of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s autobiography "Magical Me" is on display as Harry and Hermione enter the store.]

==Flying to Hogwarts==
[The Ford Anglia is parked at King's Cross Station as numerous people walk past it. In the station, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Percy, Fred, George, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are desperate to catch the Hogwarts Express before it leaves.]
:Mr. Weasley: 10:58. Come on, come on!
:Mrs. Weasley: Train will be leaving any moment!
:Mr. Weasley: Fred, George, Percy, you first! [Fred pushes his cart through the barrier to Platform 9¾, followed by Percy and George]
:Mrs. Weasley: [patting Ginny on the back] Okay. [Ginny pushes her cart and runs through the wall; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley follow]
:Mr. Weasley: After you, dear. [Mrs. Weasley disappears through the wall; Mr. Weasley goes in immediately after her]
:Mrs. Weasley: [meeting up with Ginny as she stands by the Hogwarts Express, which is just about ready to go] Come on, Ginny. We'll get you a seat. Hurry! [the three run for the train; outside, only Harry and Ron are left]
:Harry: [turning to Ron] Let's go.
[Ron nods; then the two boys push their carts directly for the wall. However, instead of going through the wall, Harry inexplicably crashes into it and falls over; Ron loses control of his cart, and falls over as well. A station agent, the same man Harry saw a year ago, notices while speaking to a woman, and approaches Harry and Ron as they get to their feet, groaning from their slight injuries.]
:Station Agent: Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
:Harry: Sorry. Lo-lost control of the trolley. [the agent shakes his head at them and walks away; Harry glances at Ron] Why can't we get through?
:Ron: I don't know. [touching the wall with his hand, discovering the bricks have become solid] The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. [Harry touches the wall to see that it's completely solid]
:Harry: [hearing a clock chime, he and Ron look up at a nearby clock displaying the time 11:00] The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it!
:Ron: [glancing at the clock in horror, then turning to Harry] Harry... if we can't get through, maybe mom and dad can't get back.
:Harry: [trying to decide what to do about their dilemma] Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
:Ron: [the sound of these words suddenly gives him an idea] The car... [Harry glances at him, wondering what he's got in mind]

==Whomping Willow==
[As the Ford Anglia flies alongside the Hogwarts Express, it puts on its headlights and flies off. Soon enough, Harry and Ron are flying over the lake, and have arrived at Hogwarts.]

:Ron: [glancing at the castle with a smile as he turns to face Harry] Welcome home. [Harry smiles, happy to be back at Hogwarts after such an unpleasant summer]

==Not Expelled... Today==
[Harry and Ron walk into the Entrance Hall with their belongings and pets, which they leave with the rest of the students' luggage.]
:Harry: See you, Hedwig! [he and Ron then run up the steps] So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform 9¾, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. [reaching the top of the stairs, they come face-to-face with the caretaker, [[Argus Filch]] and his pet cat, [[Mrs. Norris]]]
:Filch: [glaring at them with a malicious smile] Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. [Harry and Ron glance at each other nervously] Oh, dear, we are in trouble. [he smiles more devilishly; moments later, Harry and Ron are standing in [[Severus Snape]]'s classroom]
:Snape: [holding up a newspaper article about their flying car at King's Cross Station] You were seen by no less than seven Muggles! [furiously throws the newspaper aside and glares at them] Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born!
:Ron: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
:Snape: Silence! [walking around his desk towards them] I assure you... that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight! As it is.
:[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]: They are not. [Harry, Ron, Snape, and Filch turn towards the doorway to see Dumbledore standing there, accompanied by his associate, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. Both of them are looking stern.]
:Harry: [glancing at Dumbledore and McGonagall] Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall.
:Snape: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
:Dumbledore: I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
:Ron: We'll go and get our stuff.
:McGonagall: What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
:Ron: Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
:McGonagall: Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight. And you will both receive detention.
[Harry and Ron turn back to Snape who casts a glare of pure venom at them]

(Extended Version)
:Dumbledore: And now I suggest that we all return to the feast. There is a delicious-looking custard tart that I am most anxious to sample.
[Dumbledore and McGonagall exit the office and Snape follows behind with a disapproving facial expression.
Harry and Ron pass Filch. Harry notices a envelope on the ground and picks it up. It's addressed to Filch and is about the basics of magic.]
:Harry: Eh, Mr. Filch, you dropped this.
[Filch eyes the envelope before he grabs it and stuffs it in his pocket fast while looking flabbergasted. Harry and Ron walk on.]


==Mandrakes; Ron's Howler==
:[The next day, the second year students are in the Herbology greenhouses as [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] enters.]

:Professor Sprout: Morning, everyone. [taps the stand to get everyone's attention] Good morning, everyone.

:Students: Good morning, Professor Sprout.

==Gilderoy Lockhart==
:[The students are seated in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, decorated with portraits of its owner: Gilderoy Lockhart; the door to the office opens and Lockhart walks out.]

:Lockhart: Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: me, Gilderoy Lockhart.

==Mudbloods and Murmurs==
:[Harry is walking down the corridor wearing his Quidditch outfit, accompanied by the rest of the team: [[Oliver Wood]], Fred, George, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and Katie Bell.]
:Oliver: I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are going to train earlier, harder, and longer. [glancing to his left, the rest of the team follows his gaze] What...? I don't believe it. [stepping out into the courtyard, they come across the Slytherin Quidditch team, also dressed for Quidditch, as Ron and Hermione are sitting nearby; Oliver directs his attention to the team's captain, Marcus Flint] Where do you think you're going, Flint?
:Marcus: Quidditch practice.
:Oliver: I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
:Marcus: Easy, Wood. I've got a note. [holds out a rolled up scroll; Wood takes it and opens it]
:Ron: Uh-oh. I smell trouble. [he and Hermione get up and walk towards the two teams]
:Oliver: [reading the parchment] I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker." [looks up from the parchment] You've got a new Seeker, who? [Marcus steps aside, and Draco steps out towards the Gryffindor team members]
:Harry: [amazed that his nemesis is now a member of the Slytherin Quidditch team] Malfoy?
:Draco: That's right. And that's not all that's new this year. [puts his broom at his side; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team examine the brooms Draco and the rest of the Slytherin team are holding]
:Ron: Those are Nimbus 2001s. How did you get those?
:Marcus: A gift from Draco's father.
:Draco: You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
:Hermione: At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
[Draco glares at her in annoyance as he takes a few steps and stops only at arms length in front of her]
:Draco: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
[Hermione glares at him with a mixture of hate and hurt as Draco sneers.]
:Ron: You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! [he takes out his wand and aims it at Draco] Eat slugs!
[Unfortunately, Ron's spell backfires, blasting him off backwards and onto the ground. Harry and Hermione immediately rush to his side.]
:Hermione: You okay, Ron? Say something!
[Ron opens his mouth as if to say something, but instead he spits out a slug.]
:Colin Creevey: [starts taking pictures of Ron] Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
:Harry: No, Colin! Get out of the way. [he and Hermione help Ron to his feet] Let's take him to Hagrid. [Ron regurgitates another slug] He'll know what to do.
[The three of them rush off to Hagrid's while the Slytherins laugh at them.]

==Writing on the Wall==
[Harry is walking into the corridor when he suddenly hears the ominous voice again]
:Ominous Voice: Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you... Let me kill you. Kill... kill... kill!
:Hermione: [she and Ron just appear out of nowhere] Harry...
:Harry: Did you hear it?
:Ron: [concerned and confused] Hear what?
:Harry: That voice.
:Hermione: [getting concerned as well] Voice? What voice?
:Harry: I heard it first in Lockhart's office, and then, again, just-- [he hears the voice once more]
:Ominous Voice: It's time.
:Harry: [getting tense] It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
:Ron: [as Harry runs past them down the corridor] "Kill"?
:Hermione: [she and Ron run after him] Harry, wait! Not so fast!
[Harry stops in the middle of the corridor, then looks down to see the floor is wet before walking to the right. Ron and Hermione run to catch up with him; they stop abruptly as they see numerous spiders scurrying away through a crack in the window.]
:Harry: Strange... I've never seen spiders act like that.
:Ron: I don't like spiders. [they then glance at something else on the floor] What's that?
:Hermione: [they gaze at a puddle of water, where they can see what appears to be bloody writing, then look up at the wall to see foreboding words written in blood which Hermione reads] "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware." It's written in blood.
:Harry: [looks to the left] Oh, no. [Hermione follows Harry's gaze and gasps when she sees what he is seeing; he walks toward a torch on the wall, tied to the torch is Mrs. Norris, frozen and seemingly scared by something] It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. [behind them, Percy walks into the corridor, leading the other Gryffindor house students]
[Soon enough, the corridor fills with students, who gaze at the bloody writing and Mrs. Norris, Madame Pomfrey expresses horror and shock; Colin gets his camera ready, but Percy stops him.]
:Draco: "Enemies of the Heir, beware." [glances at the Gryffindor house students] You'll be next, Mudbloods. [Ron scowls and glares at him]
:Filch: What's going on here? [pushing his way through the crowd] Go on, make way, make way. [glares at Harry] Potter... what are you...? [gazes past Harry at the frozen form of his cat and trembles] Mrs. Norris? [glares at Harry again] You murdered my cat.
:Harry: No. No.
:Filch: [as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle grin] I'll kill you. [smiles wickedly at Harry then grabs him by the shirt] I'll kill you!
:Dumbledore: Argus? [Filch lets go of Harry; the students step aside as Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape arrive on the scene] Argus, I... [he glances at the writing on the wall] Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. [the students turn to leave; Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow] Everyone except [Harry, Ron, and Hermione stop] you three. [they turn to face him]
:Ravenclaw Prefect: Ravenclaws, follow me.
:Dumbledore: She's not dead, Argus. [Filch trembles, presumably from relief and confusion] She has been petrified.
:Lockhart: Ah. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
:Dumbledore: [smiles and nods] But how she has been petrified I cannot say.
:Filch: [gesturing towards Harry] Ask him. It's him that done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
:Harry: It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.
:Filch: Rubbish.
:Snape: If I might, headmaster. Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I for one don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
:Lockhart: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fanmail.
:Hermione: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We just found him when he said... [looks at Harry]
:Snape: Yes, Ms. Granger?
:Harry: When I said I wasn't hungry. [Snape turns towards him] We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. [Snape turns towards Professor Dumbledore]
:Dumbledore: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
:Filch: [as Snape smiles slightly] My cat has been petrified. I want to see some punishment!
:Dumbledore: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made, which will revive Mrs. Norris. [Filch trembles] And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution... to all.
[Harry, Ron, and Hermione nod. Moments later, they are walking along the Grand Staircase, as the numerous staircases change.]
:Hermione: [as they ascend the stairs] It's a bit strange isn't it?
:Harry: "Strange"?
:Hermione: [turns to face him] You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up petrified. It's just... strange.
:Harry: You think I should've told them, Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
:Ron: Are you mad?
:Hermione: No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. [turns and walks along]
:Man in Painting: She's right, you know. [Harry and Ron glance at him, then walk along]

==About the Chamber==
:McGonagall: [at Transfiguration class the next day] Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. [Draco shrugs] Like so. [turns to a bird resting on a post to her right, tapping it with her wand as she speaks] One, two, three, Vera Verto. [a stream of magic emits from her wand, and the bird becomes a goblet; the other students express amazement] Now it's your turn? Who would like to go first? [approaches Ron] Ah! Mr. Weasley. One, two, three, Vera Verto.
:Ron: Ahem! [silently taps his wand towards Scabbers three times] Vera Verto. [his wand causes Scabbers to turn into a furry goblet with his tail moving around while squeaking; Harry and some of the other students grin and laugh]
:McGonagall: [as Ron picks up the Scabbers-goblet] That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. [Hermione raises her hand] Yes, Ms. Granger?
:Hermione: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. [Draco gives Hermione a surprised look]
:McGonagall: [glancing around the room and seeing that the students look somewhat interested] Very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]], [[Rowena Ravenclaw]], and [[Salazar Slytherin]]. Now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.
:Ron: [turns to Harry] Three guesses who.
:McGonagall: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. [Hermione and Draco glare at each other] Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Well, shortly before departing, he sealed it, until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber, and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
:Hermione: Muggle-borns. [Professor McGonagall points her wand at her in an affirmative gesture]
:McGonagall: Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such Chamber has been found. [turns and walks back to her desk]
:Hermione: Professor, [Professor McGonagall turns around] what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
: McGonagall: Well, the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster. [Hermione feels a sense of dread at these words; a horrified Ron turns around to look at Draco, who grins smugly at him]
:Ron: [as he, Harry, and Hermione walk down the corridor] Do you think it's true? Do you really think there is a Chamber of Secrets?
:Hermione: Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
:Harry: [as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle walk down the corridor behind them] But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it really has been opened, then that means...
:Hermione: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
:Ron: [as Draco and Goyle walk past them, with Crabbe running to keep up] Let's think... [glances at their adversaries as they pass] who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
:Hermione: If you're talking about Malfoy...
:Ron: Of course! You heard him: "You'll be next, mudbloods."
:Hermione: I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
:Harry: Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family, the whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
:Ron: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
:Hermione: Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult, not to mention, we'd be breaking fifty school rules, and it'll be dangerous, very dangerous.

==Rogue bludger==
:[In the library, Hermione pulls a book titled "Most Potente Potions" off the shelf, then walks a few rows to where Harry and Ron are.]

:Hermione: Here it is, the Polyjuice Potion. [reads from the book] "Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."

:Ron: You mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

:Hermione: Yes.

:Ron: [he and Harry exchange grins] Wicked. Malfoy will tell us anything.

:Hermione: [smiles slightly at their motivation] Exactly, but it's tricky. [glancing at the book again] I've never seen a more complicated potion.

:Harry: Well, how long will it take to make?

:Hermione: [looking up at Harry] A month.

:Harry: A month?! But, Hermione... if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!

:Hermione: I know, but it's the only plan we've got.

==No longer safe==
:[Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid run to Harry as Lockhart runs to him followed by another group of students.]

:Harry: [as his friends reach him] Thank you.

:Hermione: Are you okay?

:Harry: No. I think my... I think my arm's broken.

:Lockhart: [kneeling down beside Harry] Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away.

:Harry: No. Not you.

==Dueling Club==
:[Harry lays in bed, shocked by what he just heard. A few days later, in the girls' bathroom, he tells Ron and Hermione what he overheard.]

:Hermione: "Again"? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?


==A Parselmouth==
:[Snape pulls Draco to his feet and pushes him forward.]

:Lockhart: [as Draco raises his wand] I said disarm only!

:Draco: Serpensortia! [swishes his wand and fires a cobra out of it; which then slithers along the playing field; Harry lowers his wand]

:Snape: [walking past Draco towards the snake] Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.

:Lockhart: Allow me, Professor Snape. [Snape stops in his tracks] Alarte ascendare! [the snake jettisons high into the air, then falls back down, raises its head and turns toward Harry with a hiss]

:Harry: Sya- hassa- she. (Leave them alone.) [the snake turns toward Justin Finch-Fletchey and hisses] Sya- hasi- heth. (Leave him alone.) [Snape watches suspiciously] Sya- hasi- heth. [the snake turns toward Harry again]
:
:Snape: Vipera. Evanesca. [He waves his wand, emitting a blast at the snake, causing it to burst into flame and disappear. A murmur runs through the audience.]
:
:Justin Finch-Fletchney: What are you playing at?!

==Nothing to tell==
:[Harry turns a corner and discovers Nearly Headless Nick, petrified with his head partially detached and floating in place. On the floor just a few feet away is Justin Finch-Fletchey, also petrified. Harry kneels down to examine his stiff body. As he does so, Filch walks out of a doorway behind him.]

:Filch: Caught in the act. [Harry turns around at the sound of his voice] I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words. [grins wickedly and walks away]

:Harry: No, Mr. Filch! Y-y-you don't understand-- [breaks off as something else catches his eye; he looks to see another group of spiders scurrying away over the wall and out a window; as he walks to the window, watching the spiders, Filch returns, accompanied by Professor McGonagall; she gasps in shock at the sight of Justin and approaches him, then glances from his body to Harry] Professor. I swear, I didn't.

:Professor McGonagall: This is out of my hands, Potter. [she and Harry then walk to an opening containing a griffin statue, the entrance to Professor Dumbledore's office] Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. [she gestures towards the statue; Harry approaches] Sherbet Lemon. [she opens her hands at the statue; the statue rotates clockwise and rises, and a staircase comes out of the floor, also rising in a clockwise fashion; Harry steps onto the staircase, stepping towards a door as the statue comes to a stop]

==Polyjuice Potion==
:[It is Christmas, and students going home for the holidays are transported across the frozen lake in sleighs pulled by white horses.]

==Harry and Ron Transformed==
:[Harry and Ron walk down a staircase to a corridor.]

==The Diary==
:[A thunderclap illuminates the dark sky outside. Inside the castle, Harry and Ron are walking on the Grand Staircase.]
:Ron: Have you spoken to Hermione?
:Harry: She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls.
:[They see water on the floor.]
:Harry: What's this?
:[They start following it.]
:Ron: Yuck!
:Harry: Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
:[Harry and Ron enter Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. She's sitting in a window and whimpering.]
:Myrtle: Come to throw something else at me?
:Harry: Why would I throw something at you?
:Myrtle: Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, when someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.
:Ron: But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you.
:Myrtle: SURE! [flies right into his face] Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it! Ten points if it goes through her stomach! [puts her arm through Ron's stomach] Fifty points if it goes through her head! [puts her arm through Ron's head]
:Harry: But who threw it at you anyway?
:Myrtle: I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell through the top of my head.
:[Myrtle flies off crying. Harry steps forward and picks up [[Tom Riddle's Diary]]. Later, Harry is examining the diary while seated at a table in the Gryffindor Common Room. All the pages are blank. He looks at the back and sees a name printed there.]
:Harry: Tom Marvolo Riddle.
:[Harry dips his quill in ink and lets a drop of it fall on the diary. The ink vanishes into the page. Harry then writes a message in the diary.]
:Harry: My name is Harry Potter.
:[The message fades out, and a new message fades in.]
:Diary: Hello, Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle.
:[Harry is stunned. He writes a second message.]
:Harry: Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
:Diary: Yes.
:Harry: Can you tell me?
:Diary:  No.
:[Frustrated, Harry puts his quill aside.]
:Diary: But I can show you. Let me take you back fifty years ago.
:[The diary flips to a page on which the text "13th June" appears. The pages then begin to glow, enveloping Harry and making him disappear into the diary.]

==Tom Riddle==
:[Harry materializes in the Hogwarts Entrance Hall, which doesn't look any different than in the present. An older boy, Tom Riddle, is standing on the staircase.]
:Harry: Excuse me, could you tell me what's going on here? [Riddle doesn't respond] Are you Tom Riddle? Hello, can you hear me?
:[Four wizards carry a student's dead body down the stairs.]
:Dumbledore: Riddle.
:[Harry and Riddle turn to see a younger version of Dumbledore on the staircase.]
:Riddle: Professor Dumbledore.
:Harry: Dumbledore?
:Dumbledore: It is not wise to be wandering around at this late hour, Tom.
:Riddle: Yes Professor, I suppose I... I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
:Dumbledore: I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true.
:Riddle: About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?
:Dumbledore: I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
:Riddle: Sir, if it all stopped... if the person responsible was caught...
:Dumbledore: Is there something you wish to tell me?
:[Riddle says nothing for a moment]
:Riddle: No, sir. Nothing.
:[Dumbledore gives Riddle a look]
:Dumbledore: Very well then. Off you go.
:Riddle: Goodnight, sir.
:[Harry follows Riddle down a Hogwarts corridor. Riddle reaches a door and, holding up his wand, enters. Inside the door is a younger version of Hagrid with a large box.]
:Hagrid: [speaking into the box] Let's get you out of there.
:Riddle: Evening, Hagrid. [Hagrid slams the box shut as Riddle enters.] I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but...
:Hagrid: You can't! You don't understand!
:Riddle: The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
:Hagrid: It wasn't him! [[Aragog]] never killed no one, never!
:Riddle: Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside.
:Hagrid: No!
:Riddle: Stand aside, Hagrid!
:Hagrid: No!
:Riddle: Cistem Aperio! [The spell hits Hagrid's box and makes it burst open. A giant spider crawls out and scurries out of the room.] Arania Exumai! [The spell misses Aragog, who escapes.]
:Hagrid: Aragog! Aragog! [He starts to go after Aragog, but Riddle levels his wand at him.]
:Riddle: I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled.
:[Hagrid lowers his head in shame.]
:Harry: [stretching out his hand] Hagrid! [The door slams shut as Harry is pulled out of the memory.] HAAAAAGRIIID! [Harry disappears from the memory and then reappears at the table in the Gryffindor Common Room.] Whoa! [He runs off.]

==Petrified==
:[aerial shot of Hogwarts]
:Harry: It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
:[cut to Harry, Ron, and Hermione in a Hogwarts courtyard]
:Hermione: It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
:Ron: We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty rotten snitch to me.
:Harry: The monster killed someone, Ron. What would any of us have done?
:Hermione: Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
:Ron: That'll be a cheerful visit. "Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?" [Hagrid is standing right behind him.]
:Hagrid: Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now would ya?
:Harry, Ron, and Hermione: [in unison] No!
:[There is an awkward moment of silence.]
:Harry: What's that you've got, Hagrid?
: Hagrid: Oh, it's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing up to do, but once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital unpetrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves, all right? [He turns to leave. At the same time, Neville rushes in.]
:Hagrid: Hello, Neville.
:Neville: [running up to Harry] Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! C'mon!
:[Neville leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione up to Harry's dormitory. The whole place has been ransacked. Ron and Hermione stand by the entrance as Harry looks through the mess.]
:Hermione: It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless it wasn't a student.
:Ron: Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.
:Harry: And they found it. [looks up from the mess] Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
:[The Gryffindor Quidditch team is preparing for a match.]
:Oliver: All right, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. [he begins leading the team out to the pitch] We're stronger, quicker, and smarter.
:Fred: And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
:Oliver: Well, that too.
:[McGonagall is blocking the way out to the Quidditch pitch.]
:Oliver: Professor McGonagall?
:McGonagall: This match has been cancelled.
:Oliver: You can't cancel Quidditch!
:McGonagall: Silence, Wood! You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see.
:[McGonagall leads Harry and Ron into the Hospital Wing.]
:McGonagall: I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock.
:[Hermione's petrified body is lying on a hospital bed.]
:Ron: Hermione!
:McGonagall: She was found near the library, along with this. [holds up a mirror] Does it mean anything to either of you?
:Harry: No.
:[The Gryffindors are gathered in their common room. McGonagall enters.]
:McGonagall: Could I have your attention, please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. [reads off a piece of parchment] All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. [sets parchment aside] I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed.
:[McGonagall leaves the room. The students all look worried.]
:Harry: We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.
:Ron: But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the Tower except for class.
:Harry: I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.

==Cornelius Fudge==
:[Harry and Ron, under the Invisibility Cloak, approach Hagrid's cabin at night. They knock at the door; Fang looks up, Hagrid puts the lid on his teapot and readies his crossbow.]

:Hagrid: Who's there? [walking to his front door and gently kicking it open] Hello? Hello? [Harry and Ron remove the cloak, Hagrid lowers it at the sight of them]

:Harry: What's that for?

:Hagrid: Oh, nothing, I was expecting, uh... it doesn't matter. Come on in, I just made a pot of tea. [he pours tea into a cup all the way to the brim]

:Harry: Hagrid, are you okay?

:Hagrid: I'm fine. I'm all right. [puts the teapot down]

:Harry: Di-did you hear about Hermione?

:Hagrid: Oh yeah. I heard about that all right.

:Harry: Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?

:Hagrid: What you have to understand about that is... [there is another knock at the door; Harry and Ron turn towards the door as Fang barks] [whispering] Quick. Under the cloak. Don't say a word, be quiet, both of you. [Harry and Ron go into a corner, where Ron throws the cloak back over them; Hagrid pushes open the door, to find Dumbledore at the door, accompanied by another older gentleman, [[Cornelius Fudge]]] Oh, Professor Dumbledore, sir.

:Professor Dumbledore: [as Fudge gives Hagrid a slight greeting smile] Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?

:Hagrid: Of course. [beckons them] Come in, come in.

:Ron: [recognizes Fudge as he enters and whispers] That's dad's boss, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic.

==Aragog==
:[Harry and Ron exit the cabin and glance to their left at the window, to see the spiders scurrying out the window, down the side of the house, towards the Forbidden Forest.]

:Harry: Come on.

:Ron: [fearfully] What?

:Harry: You heard what Hagrid said: "Follow the spiders."

:Ron: They're heading to the Dark Forest! [Harry walks towards the forest, carrying Hagrid's lantern; Ron reluctantly follows] Why spiders? Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies"? Harry, I don't like this. Harry, I don't like this at all.
:
:Harry: Shush!
:
:Ron: Can we go back now?

==Spider attack==
:[Numerous spiders are descending from a massive hive high above towards Harry and Ron.]

:Harry: [glancing at Aragog again] Well... thank you. We'll just... go.

:Aragog: Go? [Ron nods fearfully] I think not. [more spiders emerge from around him] My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. [as hundreds more spiders appear from the trees] Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

:Ron: [glancing at Harry in terror] Can we panic now? [a big spider lands right next to the boys; Ron points his wand at it in fear, while Harry swings the lantern at it, then at another spider before throwing the lantern to the ground and taking out his wand before he and Ron stand back to back as the spiders surround them] Know any spells?

:Harry: One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.

:Ron: Where's Hermione when you need her?

:[The spiders inch closer to the boys. At the moment, the sound of a car engine is heard; Harry and Ron look in the direction of the noise, to see the Ford Anglia drive into Aragog's nest, towards them; they back away towards Aragog as the car comes to a stop, then opens its doors for them.]

:Harry: Let's go! [they run for the car; a pair of spiders come in for the attack; Ron whimpers as he gets in on the driver's side, closing the door on a spider's leg, but manages to pull itself free; Harry points his wand at the other spider as he reaches the passenger's door] Arania Exumai! [a beam emits from his wand, blasting the spider away; Harry gets in the car and closes the door, one spider lands on top of the car, while another lands on the hood] Go!

:[Ron puts the car in reverse, and it backs away as fast as it can, as they go under a tree root, the spider on the roof falls off onto its back. The car then goes flying backwards over a hill.]

:Harry and Ron: Whoa! [as the car lands on the forest floor, the spider on the hood falls off; the car then comes to a stop]

:Ron: [grips the steering wheel, then turns to face Harry] Glad we're out of there.

:[Suddenly, another spider climbs onto the car, and sticks its head through the window; Harry jumps as the spider goes for Ron, putting its pincers around his neck; taking his hands off the steering wheel, Ron tries to get the spider off, squirming and screaming. Harry calmly reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wand, and points it at his frightened friend. Ron, his eyes and nostrils wide with terror, moves to the left, giving Harry a clear shot at the spider trying to eat him.]

:Harry: Arania Exumai! [a beam of white light emits from Harry's wand, blasting the spider off Ron and away from the car]

:Ron: [glancing out the window and turning to Harry again] Thanks for that.

:Harry: [putting his wand back in his pocket] Don't mention it. [looks out the windshield as a twitching sound is heard and squints; the spiders appear at the top of the hill, and begin moving towards the car; seeing the spiders, Ron whimpers] Get us out of here. Now! [Ron puts the car in reverse] Come on! Come on, move faster! [the boys scream as Ron makes a sharp turn] Come on, go! [Ron puts the car in drive, and steps on the gas; as they drive through the forest, the spiders pursue the car, moving almost as fast as cheetahs] Get us in the air.

:Ron: [pushing the gear] The flying gear's jammed! [the spiders gather at a tree branch up ahead, intent on intercepting the Ford Anglia]

:Harry: Come on. Pull!

:Ron: I'm trying!

:[As they drive into the pack of spiders, knocking them aside, the car takes the air, with one spider managing to grab hold of the car before falling to the ground. Flying over the trees, the car descends and lands a few feet from Hagrid's house before coming to a complete stop in front of the house; Harry opens his car door and lets Fang out.]

:Ron: [evidently furious that Hagrid had to put them in such danger] "Follow the spiders". "Follow the spiders"! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him. [the Ford Anglia backs up as Fang reenters Hagrid's house, then drives past Harry and Ron, and back into the forest again] I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?

:Harry: We know one thing: Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets; he was innocent.

==Missing==
:[The next day, Harry and Ron are visiting Hermione in the Hospital Wing again; Harry takes the old dried up flowers out of the vase next to Hermione's bed, puts in some new white flowers (most likely roses), then sits on the bed.]

:Harry: Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever.

:[Hermione just lays there with her glossy facial expression as Ron sighs sadly. Harry rubs Hermione's left hand; feeling something in it, he looks down and removes his hand to discover a crumpled up piece of paper, a library book page, which he carefully removes and straightens out.]

:Ron: [glancing at the page] What's that?

:Harry: [examining the page] Ron, this is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. [glances at the page and then back at Ron as he gets up] Come on! [Harry and Ron walk through the corridor as Harry reads from the page] "Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the [[The Basilisk|Basilisk]]. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it..." [looking up at Ron] Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.

:Ron: [processing the information they just read] But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

:Harry: [thinking for a few seconds then looking at the window] Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. [they walk along as they go over how each of the victims were petrified] Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost. He couldn't die again. And Hermione... had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.

:Ron: And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.

:Harry: [thinking about how Mrs. Norris got petrified, then remembering] The water... There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection. [Ron nods; Harry takes another look at the page, then walks to a nearby torch to more easily read the page, running his finger along it as he reads] "Spiders flee before it." It all fits.

:Ron: But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake, someone would've seen it.

:Harry: [as he and Ron glance at the bottom of the page where the word "Pipes" is written] Hermione's answered that, too.

:Ron: Pipes? It's using the plumbing!

:Harry: Remember what Aragog said about that girl fifty years ago, she died in a bathroom? What if she never left?

:Ron: Moaning Myrtle. [Harry nods]

:Professor McGonagall: [on the speakers] All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. [Ron glances at Harry in surprise, wondering what could be going on now] All teachers to the second floor corridor immediately.

:[Harry and Ron hurry to the second floor corridor. In the section where the bloody message is, Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, Madam Pomfrey, and Filch run up to the wall, where Professor McGonagall directs their attention to a newly written message.]

:Professor McGonagall: As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. [Harry and Ron walk into the corridor behind them] Our worst fear has been realized, a student has been taken by the monster, into the Chamber itself. [sadly looks at the others] The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

:Lockhart: [happily walking up to the group] So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? [grins at Snape and McGonagall]

:Snape: A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

:Lockhart: [slightly stunned] My... moment?

:Snape: Weren't you saying just last night you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? [Lockhart looks bewildered]

:Professor McGonagall: That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.

:Lockhart: Very well. I'll just be in my office, getting, uh... getting ready. [turns and walks away; Filch watches him, then glances at Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall]

:Madam Pomfrey: Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?

:Professor McGonagall: [glances at her] Ginny Weasley. [Harry and Ron straighten up in shock; Ron quavers slightly]

:[Professor McGonagall sadly walks away, along with the other staff; a second later, Snape follows them, revealing the newly written message, which reads "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever".]

:Ron: [reads the message with dread in his voice] "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever." [Harry looks at Ron as he's becoming all the more devastated by his sister's abduction] Ginny...

==Chamber of Secrets==
:Harry: [as he and Ron race into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and up the stairs to Lockhart’s office] Lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try to get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know! [opening the door to the office and stepping inside] Professor, we have some information for you. [Lockhart stuffs some clothes into his trunk, which he closes as he turns toward them; Ron scowls at him] Are you going somewhere?

:Lockhart: Um... well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Uh, got to go.

:Ron: [outraged] What about my sister?!

:Lockhart: Uh, well, um... As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.

:Ron: [in disbelief] You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can’t go now!

:Lockhart: [as he stuffs his things in his handbag then moves around his desk] Well, I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the job description about--

:Harry: [blocking his path] You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?!

:Lockhart: Books can be misleading.

:Harry: You wrote them!

:Lockhart: [placing his bag on his desk] My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!

:Harry: [staring at Lockhart] You're a fraud. You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!

:Ron: [as Lockhart directs his attention to him] Is there anything you can do?

:Lockhart: Yes. Now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with memory charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. [Harry and Ron look at each other as Lockhart walks toward his suitcase] In fact, uh... I'm uh... [Ron nods at Harry, and they both reach into their robes to pull out their wands] going to have to do the same to you. [he collects his wand from the suitcase, but Harry and Ron already have their wands trained on him]

:Harry: Don't even think about it. [points downward, gesturing for Lockhart to drop his wand; Lockhart reluctantly does so]

:[In her bathroom, Moaning Myrtle is floating around crying as Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter.]

:Myrtle: Oh? Who's there? [seeing Harry, she smiles warmly at him] Oh, hello, Harry. What do you want?

:Harry: To ask you how you died.

:Myrtle: [smiles slightly] Oh... [her smile fades] ...it was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then... I heard somebody come in.

:Harry: Who was it, Myrtle?

:Myrtle: [choked up] I don't know. I was distraught! [floats towards the three] But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language, and I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away, and... I died.

:Harry: Just like that? How?

:Myrtle: I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes, over there, by that sink. [points at the circle of sinks in the center of the bathroom]

:[As Myrtle floats off to the stalls, Harry steps forward to examine the sinks. Reaching up to the circular stone above the sinks, he moves his hand downward to the sink in front of him; he turns the tap, but no water comes out. At that second, something else catches his eye; looking more closely at the tap, he sees a snake carved on it.]

:Harry: This is it. [taking a step back] This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. [Lockhart glances at the sink in surprise]

:Ron: Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.

:Harry: [after a few seconds] Hesha- Hassah. (Open up.)

:[The circular stone above the sinks rises, then all the sinks begin to move outwards. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart back away slowly as the sinks move; the sink with the snake carved on its tap descends into the floor, then a grating slides over it. Lockhart steps towards the opening that the sinks concealed and looks down into a very wide black hole]

:Lockhart: [inhales then turns to Harry with a grin] Excellent, Harry. Ah, good work. Well, then, I'll just be, uh... there's no need for me to stay. [he tries to run, but Harry and Ron grab hold of him]

:Harry: Oh, yes there is! [with all their might, they push Lockhart backwards toward the passage before drawing their wands] You first.

:Lockhart: Now, boys, what good will it do?

:Ron: Better you than us. [Harry nods]

:Lockhart: Um, but... obviously, yes. [he nervously turns around and grips the sinks as he looks down into the passage before glancing over his shoulder at the boys again] Sure you don't want to test it first? [annoyed, Ron pokes Lockhart with his wand, sending him into the passage, screaming as he disappears into the darkness; a second later, a crash is heard as Harry and Ron walk up to the opening] It's really quite filthy down here.

:Harry: All right. [turns to Ron] Let's go. [Ron nods in agreement]

:Myrtle: Oh, Harry? [the two boys look up at her] If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. [she giggles; making Ron uneasy]

:Harry: Uh... thanks, Myrtle. [smiles at her, then turns to the opening, and jumps into it; Ron immediately jumps in after him]

:[Harry and Ron scream as they go down a slide, which leads to a small pit filled with animal bones, most likely the Basilisk's feeding area, as Lockhart brushes the dirt off his robes when the boys land. They immediately get to feet and point their wands at him.]

:Ron: [glancing at the muck around them] Ugh.

:Harry: [stepping on the bones] Now, remember: any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. [he turns and goes into the passageway behind him]

:Ron: Go on. [Lockhart reluctantly follows Harry into the passage with Ron right behind him]

==Backfire==
:Harry: [coming to another passageway to the right, he beckons Ron and Lockhart to follow him] This way. [the three walk into a cavern-like room with a massive and lengthy snakeskin on the floor]
:
:Ron: [as Harry walks along the snakeskin] What's this?

:Lockhart: [feeling nervous] It looks like a... snake.

:Harry: [as he examines it] It's a snakeskin.

:Ron: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long. Or more. [Lockhart faints, most likely from fear] [sarcastically as Harry turns his attention to Lockhart] Heart of a lion, this one.

:Lockhart: [suddenly grabbing Ron's wand and getting to his feet while breathing wickedly and pointing the wand at Harry] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl, [points the wand at Ron] how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [points the wand at Harry again] ...you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. [waves the wand wildly as he shouts] Obliviate!

:[The wand emits green light, causing Lockhart to fly backwards, slam into the wall, then fall to the floor. A couple seconds later, a rumbling begins, then rocks begin to fall from the ceiling; Harry takes cover as huge rocks go flying over him while Ron backs up against the wall as the rocks form a massive pile.]

:Ron: [coughing from the dust produced by the rocks] Harry! [Harry pulls his robe free from one of the rocks] Harry!

:Harry: [running to a opening in the big pile of rocks separating him from Ron] Ron! Ron, are you okay?

:Ron: I'm fine!

:Lockhart: [groans and sits up] Hello. Who are you?

:Ron: Um... Ron Weasley.

:Lockhart: Really? And, uh... who-who am I?

:Ron: [realizing Lockhart has erased his own memory by accident, he turns toward Harry again] Lockhart's memory charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!

:Lockhart: [picks up a small rock as Harry watches through the opening] It's an odd sort of place this is, isn't it? [tosses the rock in his hand then glances at Ron] Do you live here?

:Ron: [taking the rock from Lockhart] No.

:Lockhart: Really? [Ron smacks Lockhart on the back of the head with the rock, knocking him out; Harry winks slightly]

:Ron: [glancing at Harry through the opening again] What do I do now?

:Harry: You wait here, and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.

:Ron: [as Harry turns and climbs down from the pile of rocks] Okay.

:[Harry draws his wand as he steps onto the floor again and walks forward. Up ahead, he sees a circular door with seven snake-shaped locks on it, and steps towards it.]

:Harry: Hesha- Hassah. (Open.)

:[An eighth snake slithers out from the door's mechanical hinge, and slithers along the door's edge, causing the other seven snakes to retract one by one. As the snake slithers back into the hinge, the door slowly opens. Harry steps forward; on the other side is the Chamber of Secrets. Harry cautiously steps through the door, into the Chamber, towards the ladder in the doorway.]

==Heir of Slytherin==
:[As the door slowly closes behind him, Harry climbs down the ladder and walks down the corridor. Looking ahead, he sees Ginny lying motionless at the end of the Chamber. She is clutching Tom Riddle's diary.]

:Harry: Ginny. [runs to her, drops his wand and gets on his knees] Ginny. No, Ginny. Please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please wake up.

:[Suddenly, Tom Riddle walks out of a nearby doorway.]

:Riddle: She won’t wake.

:[Harry recognizes his voice and turns toward him. Riddle walks to him.]

:Harry: Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won’t wake? She’s not...?

:Riddle: She’s still alive, but only just.

:Harry: Are you a ghost?

:Riddle: A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.

:Harry: [reaches out and touches Ginny] She's as cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [while Harry's not looking, Riddle bends down and picks up Harry's wand from where he left it] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a Basilisk. 

:Riddle: It won't come until it's called. 

:Harry: [looks up to see Riddle holding his wand and stands up] Give me my wand, Tom.

:Riddle: You won't be needing it.

:Harry: Listen, we've got to go. We've got to save her!

:Riddle: I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. [Harry looks at him, confused] Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. [Ginny is shown standing in front of the sink in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom as it opens]

:Harry: No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

:Riddle: It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [Ginny is show using her blood-covered fingers to write on the wall]

:Harry: But why?

:Riddle: Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. [as Ginny is shown running into a stall and throwing the diary into the toilet] Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then, who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.

:Harry: [stands in front of the Slytherin statue] And why did you want to meet me?

:Riddle: I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.

:Harry: [angrily] Hagrid's my friend! [calms down slightly] And you framed him, didn't you?

:Riddle: It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.

:Harry: [smirks at him] I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.

:Riddle: He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. [walks around Harry as he speaks] I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, I would be able to lead another, to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

:Harry: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.

:Riddle: [smiles maliciously] Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. [Harry looks at him in surprise] How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape [pushes Harry's hair aside with his wand to see his scar] with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?

:Harry: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

:Riddle: [smiles wickedly] Voldemort is... my past, present, and future. [turns toward the statue and uses Harry's wand to write his full name in flaming letters; after writing the "E", he flicks the wand, and the letters rearrange themselves to say "I AM LORD VOLDEMORT]

:Harry: [as the letters fade and Riddle turns to face him] You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. [Riddle stares evilly at Harry] You're Voldemort.

:Riddle: Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!

:Harry: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!

:Riddle: Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!

:Harry: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Harry and Riddle glare at each other; a musical sound is heard nearby; Harry and Riddle look down the corridor to see Fawkes flying towards them, carrying something] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops a bundled-up object into Harry's hands as he flies over and around them, then back down the corridor; Harry unrolls the object, which turns out to be the Sorting Hat]

:Riddle: So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender: A songbird and an old hat. [backs away from Harry as he continues examining the Sorting Hat, then walks toward the Slytherin statue and extends his left hand] Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine. (Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four.) 

==The Basilisk==
:[Harry turns to face the statue of Salazar Slytherin as a rumbling begins; Riddle turns around to face him as the statue's mouth starts to open.]

:Riddle: Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter.

:[Harry gulps and turns toward the statue again as he hears an ominous snarling that appears to be coming from inside the statue and hyperventilates; Riddle turns to face the statue's mouth as the Basilisk shrieks "Hungry!" from within the statue. The stone slab concealing the statue's mouth stops descending; a split second afterwards, the Basilisk emerges from the darkness and starts to come into the light, growling menacingly. Harry throws the Sorting Hat onto the floor in front of Ginny and races back towards the door to the Chamber as the Basilisk's head comes out of the statue's mouth and its snake-like body lowers into the surrounding water; Riddle, immune to the Basilisk's lethal gaze, watches the creature.]

:Riddle: Sethae- He- This! (Kill him!) [turns his attention to the fleeing Harry as the Basilisk's body curves to its right behind it] Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. [the Basilisk's tail drops into the water behind him] It only obeys me! 

:[The Basilisk slithers after Harry with a ferocious growl. Harry races down the corridor as fast as he can while the Basilisk is in hot pursuit; unfortunately, Harry loses his footing on the slippery floor and trips, allowing the Basilisk to catch up with him. His glasses clatter to the floor in front of him; he immediately puts them back on before realizing the Basilisk is right above him and covers his head with his hands. Just as the Basilisk is about to attack Harry, Fawkes emits his cry, getting their attention. Fawkes swoops down, going directly for the Basilisk, and attacks the colossal snake, pecking at it, with Harry observing their fight by watching their shadows on the wall.]

:Riddle: No! Your bird may have blinded the Basilisk, but it can still hear you.

:[Harry turns around to see that the Basilisk's yellow eyes are bloody. The Basilisk thrashes around furiously as Fawkes flies off; Harry gets to his feet, and steps backwards, stepping into something slimy, causing a splattering sound; Harry looks down to see what he stepped in. At the same time, the Basilisk stops thrashing about and blindly glares at Harry, who looks up again and makes a run for a passageway to his right. The Basilisk lunges at Harry, nearly getting him. Harry, breathing heavily, runs as fast as he can, into a tunnel just to his left as the Basilisk lunges at him again, smashing through a stalactite. Harry runs through the tunnel, looking back to see if the Basilisk is still behind him; he turns left into an alcove, only to find his path blocked by a grate. He struggles to move it, but turns around upon hearing the Basilisk coming into the tunnel. He steps back against the grate, as the Basilisk comes to his position. The Basilisk hisses at him and approaches him with its mouth open. Harry picks up a rock at his feet and throws it; the sound of the rock distracts the Basilisk, who slithers off into another passageway. Harry races back into the Chamber where Riddle and Ginny are.]

:Riddle: Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. [Harry puts his hand on Ginny's hand again] In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. [Harry looks up at him] Lord Voldemort will return... very... much... alive.

:Harry: [glancing at Ginny again] Ginny...

:[The Basilisk bursts out of the water surrounding the Slytherin statue and thrashes about; Harry turns toward the Sorting Hat, where a sword magically appears. Harry, without hesitation, grabs the sword and holds it up defensively as the Basilisk slithers toward him. Harry races for the statue and begins to climb it; the Basilisk blindly follows Harry's movements, using its tongue to track his location and lifts its body off the floor. The Basilisk uses its tongue again to find Harry's current position directly in front of it; Harry swings the sword at the Basilisk; it lunges directly at him, he dodges, and it smashes right into the statue. Harry climbs higher as the Basilisk lunges at him again, missing again; Harry climbs onto the top of the statue's head, the Basilisk lunges at Harry repeatedly as he swings the sword wildly at the creature. Eventually, the Basilisk sends Harry rolling down the side of the statue, causing him to lose the sword.]

:Harry: [seeing the sword about to slide off the top of the statue's head] No.

:[Harry hurries to retrieve the sword; the Basilisk lunges right at Harry once more. Harry stops the sword just in time, and rams it right through the Basilisk's upper jaw. The Basilisk bellows in pain until Harry pulls the sword out. Harry screams in pain as one of the Basilisk's venomous fangs just fell into his arm; he pulls the fang out, unfortunately, the venom is already in his bloodstream. The Basilisk thrashes around, roaring and bellowing in pain, collapsing under its weight, and falls backwards to the floor, dead, splashing water everywhere; Riddle stares at the Basilisk's corpse in disbelief.]

==Healing Powers==
:[Harry limps past the Basilisk's corpse, and, dropping the sword and falling to his knees, he crawls towards Ginny once more as Riddle walks toward them.]

:Riddle: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body. I guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. [Harry extends his left hand to Ginny's again] Funny... the damage a silly little book can do... especially in the hands of a silly little girl. [Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's arm and carefully pulls it out, placing it on the floor between her and the Basilisk fang] What are you doing? [Harry picks up the Basilisk fang and holds it up while staring at Riddle, who immediately realizes what Harry is about to do] Stop. No!

:[Harry stabs one of the diary's pages with the fang as Riddle steps forward to try and stop him; Riddle's body crumbles and gives a discharge of yellow light; ink starts to ooze from the diary, Riddle recoils and growls with rage; Harry pries the fang out. Riddle attempts to attack, but Harry stabs the other page, crippling Riddle, and causing him to crumble further; Harry closes the diary and stabs the cover with the Basilisk fang; Riddle screams in agony and disintegrates into yellow particles; shortly after Riddle's demise, Ginny awakens, hyperventilating, and sits up.]

:Harry: Ginny.

:Ginny: [turning to face him] Harry, it was me. But, I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. And... [notices Harry's injury] Harry... you're hurt.

:Harry: [covering his wound] Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. [Fawkes emits his song again; Harry and Ginny both look down the corridor to see him flying towards them; he swoops around the Basilisk's body, and lands in between them, then steps over to Harry] You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. [Fawkes emits a soft grunt, then lowers his head to Harry's wound, and cries on it; the wound miraculously disappears; Ginny stares in amazement] Of course! [lifting his healed arm] Phoenix tears have healing powers. [Fawkes grunts affirmatively as Harry glances at him] Thanks. [looks at Ginny] It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.

:[Fawkes then flies Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny out of the Chamber of Secrets.]

:Lockhart: Amazing! This is just like magic!

:[Fawkes carries the four of them up towards the opening of a cave as the moon can be seen above them.]

==Out of the Hat==
:[Harry and Ron stand before Professor Dumbledore in his office, with Fawkes on his perch, and the sword and Sorting Hat resting on the desk.]

:Professor Dumbledore: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours, you have broken, perhaps, a dozen school rules.

:Harry and Ron: Yes, sir.

:Professor Dumbledore: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.

:Harry and Ron: Yes, sir.

:Professor Dumbledore: Therefore, it is only fitting... [Harry and Ron look up] that you both receive special awards for services to the school. [Harry and Ron look at each other with smiles, then back at Dumbledore again]

:Ron: Thanks, sir.

:Professor Dumbledore: [smiles at the boys, then stands up while handing some papers to Ron] And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we... we want our gamekeeper back. [turns to Harry as Ron leaves the room] Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must've shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could've called Fawkes to you. And, second... I sense something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?

:Harry: You see, sir. I couldn't help but notice certain things... certain... certain similarities between... Tom Riddle and me.

:Professor Dumbledore: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because, Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.

:Harry: [amazed] Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?

:Professor Dumbledore: Uh-huh. Not intentionally. But yes.

:Harry: [as Dumbledore returns to his seat behind the desk] So, the Sorting Hat was right; I should be in Slytherin.

:Professor Dumbledore: It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes: Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?

:Harry: [glancing at the Sorting Hat] Because I asked it to.

:Professor Dumbledore: Exactly, Harry, exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest you look more closely [picks up the sword] at this. [Harry takes the sword by the blade with his left hand, and its hilt with his right] Be careful.

:Harry: [examines the sword and sees the name "Godric Gryffindor" on the Basilisk venom-coated blade] Godric Gryffindor.

:Professor Dumbledore: Ah. It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. [Harry looks at Dumbledore]

==Dobby's Reward==
:[The door to the office opens, Dumbledore glances past Harry, who turns around; Lucius Malfoy steps in to the office, standing behind him is Dobby.]

:Harry: Dobby! So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys. 

:Dobby: [nervously looking at Harry] Mm-hmm. [fearfully glances up at Lucius]

:Lucius: [through clenched teeth] I'll deal with you later. [Dobby cowers and whimpers; Lucius pulls out his walking stick and walks toward Dumbledore's desk, followed by Dobby; as he walks up the steps, he coldly uses the stick to push Harry aside] Out of my way, Potter. So... it's true. You have returned.

:Professor Dumbledore: When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.

:Lucius: [angrily] Ridiculous!

==Welcome Back==
:[It is the end of year feast; Nearly Headless Nick, now revitalized, floats along the row between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables in the Great Hall.]

:Female Student: Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!

:Nearly Headless Nick: Thank you.

:Another Female Student: Good evening, Sir Nicholas.

:Nearly Headless Nick: Good evening.

:Male Student: Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.

:Nearly Headless Nick: Thank you. [glancing at another pair of students] Hello. [reaching the doors to the Great Hall, he passes Filch, who is just happy to have Mrs. Norris back, and Hermione walks in as he turns toward her] Hermione! Welcome back.

:Hermione: Thanks, Sir Nicholas. [Nearly Headless Nick floats away as Hermione glances at the Gryffindor table]
